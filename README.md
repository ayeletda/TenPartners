# TenPartners

TenPartners, winner of the 2011 Jewish Futures Competition, is a non-profit platform that enables
young Jews to collaborate and create great Jewish experiences for their local Jewish
communities. We make Jewish community service more grass-roots, collaborative and accessible
to a new generation of lay leaders. Members of a TEN partnership fund equal, small one-time
donations into a local bank account that they manage, and then evaluate and vote on program
proposals using our custom-built and easy-to- use collaboration platform. Members take turns
(voluntarily) taking responsibility for a specific project. The TEN partnership system fosters
creativity, involvement, collaboration and leadership without demanding large amounts of time or
money or in-person meetings.

A TEN partnership's programs must be financially sustainable - they must be designed to recoup
their underwritten cost, so that the partnership stays “evergreen” without needing further funding.

The dinosaur/institution model of Jewish communal organizations is by and large not attracting
our next generation of communal lay leaders. tenpartners' unique technology platform and
communal action business model enables or addresses many of the major hot-button issues
facing the Jewish communal world today.
